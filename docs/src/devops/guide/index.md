## Re-building containers

**Containers need to be rebuilt if changes have been made in `SAEOSS-Portal/pyproject.toml` or if a new sql migration has been added in `ckanext/saeoss/migration`**

1. Cd into `SAEOSS-Portal/docker`
2. Run `./compose.py --compose-file docker-compose.yml --compose-file docker-compose.dev.yml down`
3. Run `./build.sh`
4. Run `./compose.py --compose-file docker-compose.yml --compose-file docker-compose.dev.yml up`
5. Run `docker exec -it saeoss_ckan-web_1 poetry run ckan search-index rebuild`

## Restarting saeoss_ckan-web_1

**Container needs to be restarted if a new template file is added to override ckan defaults for the change to reflect**

1. Open up a terminal
2. Run `docker restart saeoss_ckan-web_1`

## Refresh pycsw materialized view

*This needs to be run periodically (once per hour is likely enough).*

1. Run `docker exec -ti saeoss_ckan-web_1 poetry run ckan saeoss pycsw refresh-materialized-view`

## Drop pycsw materialized view

1. Run `docker exec -ti saeoss_ckan-web_1 poetry run ckan saeoss pycsw drop-materialized-view`

## Common errors in containers

### Datasets have disappeared from the search page

Solr index needs be rebuilt

**Steps to fix**

1. Open up a terminal
2. Run `docker exec -it saeoss_ckan-web_1 poetry run ckan search-index rebuild`

### SQL Rollback error

When you encounter the following error `Canâ€™t reconnect until invalid transaction is rolled back. Please rollback() fully before proceeding`:

1. Open up a terminal
2. Run `docker stop saeoss_ckan-web_1`
3. Run `docker stop saeoss_ckan-db_1`
4. Run `docker start saeoss_ckan-web_1`
5. Run `docker start saeoss_ckan-db_1`

### Refresh mv not working

Running docker exec -ti saeoss_ckan-web_1 poetry run ckan saeoss pycsw refresh-materialized-view produces error

**Steps to reproduce**

1. When `docker exec -ti saeoss_ckan-web_1 poetry run ckan saeoss pycsw create-materialized-view` is run and no tags are saved within a dataset, the materialized view gets created as a table instead
2. This in turn produces sql error when trying to refresh

**Solution**

1. In the postgres editor run  `DROP TABLE saeoss_pycsw_view;`
2. Add tags to datasets
3. Run `docker exec -ti saeoss_ckan-web_1 poetry run ckan saeoss pycsw create-materialized-view`

### There is no data in pycsw

1. Connect to the database hosted in container `saeoss_ckan-db_1`
2. RUN sql script `DROP table saeoss_pycsw_view`
3. Run the following sql script (script location can also be found at `ckanext/saeoss/templates/pycsw/pycsw_view.sql`)
```
