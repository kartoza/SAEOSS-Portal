# Project Prerequisites

## Installation of Docker

Ensure that Docker is installed on the machine where the environment will be set up using Docker Compose.
Follow the official Docker installation guide for your operating system to install Docker: [Docker Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

## Minimal Dependencies Outside Docker

Since the environment is set up using Docker Compose, there are minimal dependencies outside Docker itself.
Docker Compose will handle the setup and orchestration of containers, so there's no need for additional software or dependencies.

## Configuration in Docker Compose

Define the services and configurations needed for the environment in the docker-compose.yml file.
Specify any required Docker images, volumes, networks, ports, environment variables, and other settings in the Docker Compose configuration.

## Sudo Rights for Docker

Ensure that the user running Docker commands has sudo rights to execute Docker commands without requiring a password.
Granting sudo rights to Docker commands can be done by adding the user to the Docker group. However, it's essential to understand the security implications of this action.

By following these points, you can ensure that Docker is installed, Docker Compose is configured, and the environment is set up smoothly within Docker containers.
