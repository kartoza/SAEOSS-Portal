# Bug Report Template
A standard workflow for creating tickets is advised to make sure enough information about the problem is related, cutting down on time developers would spend trying to understand the issue at hand. To mitigate this a general approach has been created to make sure users are able to create a GitHub ticket with as much detail as possible. 

> **NOTE:** *Github supports various forms of media including: Markdown syntax, images and video. All of these can be used to better and more accurately describe your issue. [Read more](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)*
