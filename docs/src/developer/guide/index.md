# SAEOSS-Portal Developer Guide

In this section of the documentation, we aim to onboard developers onto the process of setting up a developer workstation, understanding the system architecture, contributing back to the project and so forth. Here is a brief overview of the content provided here:

* **[Architecture:](./architecture.md)** Here we outline the system architecture using ER Diagrams, Software Component Diagrams etc.
* **[Prerequisites:](./prerequisites.md)** An overview of the software that needs to be installed before you can start.
* **[Cloning:](./cloning.md)** In this section we cover how to make a local working copy on your own machine.
* **[IDE Setup:](./ide-setup.md)** Here we walk through setting up your IDE.
* **[Building:](./building.md)** This covers tasks related to building the application so you can test it in your browser.
* **[Configuration:](./configuration.md)** This covers standard configuration tasks that need to be done once the site is brought online.
* **[Workflows:](./workflows.md)** Examples of typical workflows for adding features, fixing bugs etc.
