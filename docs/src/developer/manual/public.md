# Public

This is a CKAN file storage system directory where publicly accessible files, including customised [assets](assets.md), are stored. 
The resources (CSS for styling, JS for JavaScript functionality, and images for graphics) in this directory are often 
part of the theme or extension to modify the default CKAN interface.
