# Scheming

This CKAN extension provides a way to configure and share metadata schemas. 

`dataset_schema.yaml` : to custom dataset schema.

`presets.yaml`: a preset specifies a set of default values for other field keys. They allow reuse of definitions for 
validation and snippets for common field types.
