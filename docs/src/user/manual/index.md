# User Manual

This section of the documentation describes every page in the application and
what the various components of that page do. The manual is intended to function
as a reference for the application. For narrative/workflow-based tutorials,
you may prefer to work through our [user guide](../guide/index.md).

* **[Home Page:](./home.md)** This is the `landing page` that you arrive on when you open the site.
* **[Dashboard:](./dashboard.md)** This is a central notification hub for communications from the SAEOSS-Portal platform.
* **[Profile:](./profile-page.md)** The profile page provides a preview of what your profile will look like when viewed by other users on the platform.
* **[Profile Settings:](./profile-settings.md)** On the profile settings page, all user profile-related settings can be managed.
* **[Organisations:](./organisation.md)** This is the `Organisations` page that allows all users to see all organisations on the platform.
* **[Metadata:](./metadata.md)** This is the `Metadata` page where you can upload new records.
* **[Map:](./map.md)** This interface displays footprints of datasets in polygon format by displaying the boundary that is covered by the respective metadata record.
* **[About:](./about.md)** This is the `About` page where users can learn more about the site.
* **[Help:](./help.md)** The help page is the documentation site.
* **[User Roles:](./user-roles.md)** Access to data and functionalities on the SAEOSS-Portal platform is governed by user roles and permissions.

## Purpose of the manual

The user manual aims to assist the user in learning the fundamentals of using the SAEOSS-portal platform. The goal of the documentation is to clear up any doubts or concerns related to workflows and will feature a page-by-page layout, making it easy for users to follow along.

## Error Reporting

We take pride and care to ensure our work is factual, accurate, and informative. In the highly unlikely event that an error or bug is found, please report it through one of the following channels:

**GitHub Issues:** GitHub is the preferred method of error reporting, ensuring reported errors are addressed in the quickest turnaround time possible. Read more about opening issues in the [Developer Workflows](../../developer/guide/workflows.md)

**Email:** Errors can be raised via email through the following channels. However, this is not a recommended path as it has long turnaround times.

<!-- We need permission to do this before implementing the mails

- info@kartoza.com
- example@sansa.com
- example@saeonn.com -->

**Administrator:** Errors can be raised with your administrator if affiliated with an organization. Administrators can escalate the error to developers if required.

**Crisp Interface:** You can report errors directly through the Crisp interface. [Read More](./home.md#crisp-interface)
