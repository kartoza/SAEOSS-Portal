# Help Page
The help page is the documentation site. Here you can find out all there is to know and how things work on the SAEOSS-Platform. The documentation is quite informative and includes documentation for all workflows on the platform, however, if you find it lacking, please consider contributing to it or creating a GitHub issue so we may improve it.

To contribute to this documentation, please review [link here](). This guide provides the workflow for contributing to the documentation and the process of creating a pull request.

Alternatively, if you would like someone else to assist with your request, please review [link here](). This approach covers the necessary steps to create a GitHub ticket allowing your developers to address the issue. 

In all cases, your support and contributions are not only welcome but greatly appreciated. We thank you for your continued support!

### Next Steps
If you have made it thus far into the documentation, you may want to review the [user guide](../guide/index.md), which provides workflow-based tutorials in the same page-by-page manner.
