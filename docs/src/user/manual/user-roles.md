# User roles

Access to data and functionalities on the SAEOSS-Portal platform is governed by user roles and permissions. User roles define a default set of permissions generally assigned to different types of users and linked to their profiles. When a new user profile is registered, it is automatically assigned to the general user role.

Individual permissions can be set by the administrator for user profiles to provide additional access to data or functionalities if required. This means that even though a user profile is assigned to the general user role, it can have access to functionalities or permissions typically reserved for admin users. Additional user roles can also be created, or default user role permissions can be changed by an administrator with the relevant access.

## Six types of users

### 1. Anonymous user

This user has search, viewing and downloading capabilities of public metadata records. This user role is not required to register, nor are they a member of any organisation.

By registering, this user has access to additional features such as the ability to save and delete searches, alter profile information, generate API key.
