# GitHub Issues/Tickets

![GitHub Logo](../img/GitHub-Mark.png){: style="height:150px"}

This GitHub project repository serves as a project planning and progress tracking platform for the development teams and clients. This repository is public and for anyone to view. The repository can be accessed [here](https://github.com/kartoza/SAEOSS-Portal).

## Tickets

Tickets on the [SAEOSS-Portal GitHub Project Board](https://github.com/kartoza/SAEOSS-Portal/issues) are created first as issues and converted into tickets to work on during the sprint at the SAEOSS-Portal catch-up meeting. This workflow ensures work required by the client gets done as well as allows the opportunity to clear up any doubts regarding work that needs to be done. When issues are created, a clear description of what needs to happen is required as well as any accompanying screenshots or videos. If a developer has any doubt, they can simply comment on the ticket, and the creator of the ticket, as well as any assigned developers, will be notified via email.

## Creating new Github issues/tickets

When encountering a new issue with the platform, it is best practice to create an issue or ticket on the [SAEOSS-Portal GitHub Issues Page](https://github.com/kartoza/SAEOSS-Portal/issues). This ensures developers are made aware of the issue at hand and can work to get the problem fixed as soon as possible.

### Templates

A standard [workflow](#workflow-for-creating-github-issues) for creating tickets is advised to make sure enough information about the problem is related, cutting down on time developers would spend trying to understand the issue at hand.

To ensure this, a general approach has been created to make sure users are able to create a GitHub ticket with as much detail as possible. The following [template](../../developer/guide/templates/bug-report-message-template.md) can be copied and used to create a new ticket.

> 🚩 *GitHub supports various forms of media, including: Markdown syntax, images, and video. All of these can be used to better and more accurately describe your issue.

### Workflow for creating GitHub issues

To report an issue, users should first access the SAEOSS-Portal [Project Page](https://github.com/kartoza/SAEOSS-Portal). Ensure you are logged in to GitHub, as users who do not have a GitHub account will not be able to create new issues. If you do not have a GitHub account you can create a [free account](https://github.com/signup?ref_cta=Sign+up&ref_loc=header+logged+out&ref_page=%2F&source=header-home).
