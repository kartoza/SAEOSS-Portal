# Logout User Guide

Logging out of the account is a simple process that ensures the security of your session. Here is a quick guide to help you through the logout procedure:

Click on the user profile icon or name to reveal the user-related options.

In the dropdown menu, click on the `Logout` option. After clicking Logout, the system will process the request and redirect you to the logout page.
