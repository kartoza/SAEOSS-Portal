# For Users

This is the homepage for all user-related documentation.

The user content is divided into three sections:

* The [quickstart tutorial](quickstart/index.md), which aims to get you familiar with the basics of the platform in around 5 minutes.
* The [user guide](guide/index.md), which describes common workflows in a tutorial format.
* The [user manual](manual/index.md), which describes each page of the user interface and what the various options on that page do.
* The [metadata standard](./research/index.md), which explains the all of the metadata elements utilised by the portal.
