# Harvesting Settings

In CKAN harvesting collects and imports metadata and datasets from external sources into a CKAN repository. 
It allows CKAN instances to aggregate and manage datasets from various distributed data catalogs, making it a valuable 
feature for organisations or communities that want to centralise and share metadata about datasets.

The harvesting process in CKAN provides several benefits:

* **Centralised Discovery**: Enables the aggregation of datasets from distributed sources into a single CKAN instance, 
providing a centralised discovery platform for users. 
* **Data Catalog Federation**: Facilitates the federation of CKAN instances or other compatible data catalogs, allowing 
them to share and exchange metadata.
Updates and Synchronisation: Allows periodic updates and metadata synchronisation, ensuring that the CKAN repository 
remains current with changes in external data sources.


To configure and manage harvesting in CKAN, administrators can use the CKAN web interface or utilise the CKAN API. 
The harvesting functionality is a powerful tool for organisations and communities interested in building comprehensive 
and collaborative data catalogs.
