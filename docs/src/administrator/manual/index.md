# Administrator Manual
<!-- Replace all of the titles with relevant titles -->

This section of the documentation describes every page in the application and
what the various components of that page do. The manual is intended to function
as a reference for the application. For narrative / workflow based tutorials,
you may prefer to work through our [Administrator guide](../guide/index.md).

The administrator manual aims to assist user in learning the fundamentals of using the SAEOSS-portal platform. 
The goal of the documentation is to clear up any doubts or concerns related to workflows and will feature a page by 
page layout, making it easy for users to follow along.
