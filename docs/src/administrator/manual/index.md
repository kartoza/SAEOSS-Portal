# Administrator Manual
<!-- Replace all of the titles with relevant titles -->

This section of the documentation describes every page in the application and
what the various components of that page do. The manual is intended to function
as a reference for the application. For narrative / workflow based tutorials,
you may prefer to work through our [Administrator guide](../guide/index.md).

The administrator manual aims to assist user in learning the fundamentals of using the SAEOSS-portal platform. The goal of the documentation is to clear up any doubts or concerns related to workflows and will feature a page by page layout, making it easy for users to follow along.

### Error reporting

We take pride and care to ensure our work is factual, accurate and informative. In the highly unlikely event that and error or bug is found please report it through one of the following channels:

**Github Issues:** Github is the preferred method of error reporting ensuring reported errors are addressed in the quickest turnaround time possible. Read more about opening issues in the [Developer Workflows](../../developer/guide/workflows.md)

**Email:** Errors can be raised via email through the following channels. However this is not a recommended path as it has long turn around times.

<!-- we need permission to do this before implementing the mails

- info@kartoza.com
- example@sansa.cm
- exanple@saeonn.com -->

**Administrator:** Alternatively users can report errors to the administrators who can report the error though one of the above mentioned channels if they are unable to resolve the issue.
