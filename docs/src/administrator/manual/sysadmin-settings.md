# Sysadmin settings

Sysadmin settings are designed to provide administrator access to manage accounts, organisations, and datasets. Certain 
administration tasks are unavailable through the web UI but require access to the server where CKAN is installed. 
This manual covers the administration features in the web UI.

## Sysadmins

The first tab, `Sysadmin`, has the list of all sysadmin users. By clicking on one user, the administrator can manage 
the user account as if it were in the [profile](profile.md).

## Config

The second tab, `Config`,  is a page where the administrator can change some configurations from the web interface. 
It is a simple interface to quickly customise the `look and feel` of CKAN.
