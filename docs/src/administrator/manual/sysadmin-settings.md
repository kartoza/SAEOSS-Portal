# Sysadmin settings

Sysadmin settings are designed to provide administrator access to manage accounts, organisations, and datasets. Certain 
administration tasks are unavailable through the web UI but require access to the server where CKAN is installed. 
This manual covers the administration features in the web UI.

the user account as if it were in the [profile](profile.md).

**Config**

The second tab, `Config`,  is a page where the administrator can change some configurations from the web interface. 
It is simple customisation to customise the `look and feel` of CKAN.
