# NOTE1: When updating this file manually, also be sure to run
# `poetry update --lock` to also update poetry's lock file

# NOTE2: Below are ckan 2.9.4 dependencies.
# ckan does not list its dependencies on the setup.py `install_requires`
# field, which means it cannot just be installed by getting the code and
# using pip install. Therefore we install the dependencies ahead of
# We are not using the exact set of
# dependencies specified in ckan's `ckan-2.9.4` release tag, but rather those
# coming from a more recent version of ckan's `master` branch - specifically
# from:
# - https://github.com/ckan/ckan/commit/c95ca83ad90887999bbbafe6d43cb7f81ecbec00
# - https://github.com/ckan/ckan/commit/5d8b1dc9da3a90ba95480fe379e3d642d8d74853
# - https://github.com/ckan/ckan/commit/472af3bf5a40cfa7ab23cee337462c18c7cf2060
# The reason for this behavior is to overcome some dificulties when installing
# the `zope.interface` dependency that was specified in ckan's `requirements.in`
# file of the 2.9.4 tag. This version was causing ckan to depend on an older
# version of setuptools, which poetry was not being able to sort out correctly
